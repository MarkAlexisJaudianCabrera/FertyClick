            We use a trunk line as we cater all over US. We have different phone numbers available per market/state.

        <p>
            (Trunk lines – or trunkings – use one central line and that disperses into multiple lines to handle
            inbound and outbound calls. The solution allows businesses to effectively manage many calls
            at once – without needing to purchase a dedicated phone line for each number.)

            <ul>
