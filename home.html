        <h4>Q. Not Interested 1:</h4>
        <p>
            Well, many of our clients love the opportunity to review options and compare quotes. 
            You may also be eligible to save money or add to your existing coverage. Let me just 
            finish up and get you over to an agent who can go over the details with you.  
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="card-con2" class="card-con">
        <h4>Q. Not Interested 2: </h4>
        <p>
            All we're doing is reviewing and comparing your options to make sure that you are 
            receiving the best coverage for the best price. If there is something that you like 
            or may not have, you can add it to your existing coverage as well. Let me get a 
            specialist on the line who can provide more details. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="card-con3" class="card-con">
        <h4>Q. No Time/Busy:</h4>
        <p>
            I can understand that you are busy, but this is something you want to take care 
            of sooner rather than later. It only takes a minute to give you the details of 
            all the benefits you qualify for and then I can have you speak with a specialist 
            who will have more information. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="card-con4" class="card-con">
        <h4>Q. Is there a Cost:</h4>
        <p>
            Most of the people we work with are on a limited or fixed income, so cost is a 
            common issue. One of the purposes of this program is to provide free or very 
            affordable options to those who may otherwise not have it in their budget. I 
            can get an agent on the line who can go over those options with you. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="card-con5" class="card-con">
        <h4>Q. Who are you calling for:</h4>
        <p>
            I’m calling because you submitted some information online that matched 
            you up with our opportunity. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="card-con6" class="card-con">
        <h4>Q. Have concerns?</h4>
        <p>
            You know, it’s totally normal to have questions so let me just finish 
            up really quick and I’ll get a specialist on the line to answer anything 
            I haven’t taken care of for you. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="card-con7" class="card-con">
        <h4>Q. Wrong Number?</h4>
        <p>
            Oh, really? According to our records, someone from this phone number 
            filled out a form online and may be interested in our program. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="card-con8" class="card-con">
        <h4>Q. Where did you get my info?</h4>
        <p>
            We’re just making a follow-up call because we missed your call or the 
            line got disconnected and you may qualify for this program.  
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="card-con9" class="card-con">
        <h4>Q. What website?</h4>
        <p>
            Well, we actually have several websites online, but unfortunately due 
            to privacy restrictions, I don’t have access to which one you were on. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="card-con10" class="card-con">
        <h4>Q. Number came up as Scam likely?</h4>
        <p>
            The reality is that most phone carriers offer an option for individual 
            users to report what they "think" is a scam. This isn’t a reflection of 
            how we conduct business and unfortunately, the phone carriers have no 
            responsibility to verify these claims or whether they are even accurate.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="card-con11" class="card-con">
        <h4>Q. Where are you located?</h4>
        <p>
            Well, I am currently sitting in our Home Office in Phoenix Arizona, 
            but we have licensed Agents available all over the country. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="card-con12" class="card-con">
        <h4>Q. Why do you want to know my age?</h4>
        <p>
            That is a great question. The promotion is only valid for customers 
            that are aged between 19-64. So, how old are you?  
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="card-con13" class="card-con">
        <h4>Q. I cannot afford it</h4>
        <p>
            This is Affordable Care Act  which is specially designed for people 
            living on low or fixed income  
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="card-con14" class="card-con">
        <h4>Q. Why don't you send me something in writing?</h4>
        <p>
            Let me tell you how we work. We work with multiple companies and after 
            we have qualified you for this promotion, we will decide the best company 
            for you and our licensed agent will be more than happy to send you the 
            information in writing with all the details and benefits. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="card-con15" class="card-con">
        <h4>Q. I believe you have Called Me Before?</h4>
        <p>
            Yes, there may be some other companies calling around, but it was not us 
            though. Now this will take just a few minutes to give you the details of 
            all the benefits you qualify for, okay?
