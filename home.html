            That’s a good question. You made an inquiry online  .

        <h4>WHY ARE YOU CALLING FROM DIFFERENT NUMBER ..?</h4>
        <p>
            We're using a voice over internet protocol that allows us to call Medicare beneficiaries using the internet because we work with Medicare providers all over the US.  That's the reason why you're seeing a different number on your end.

    </div>

    <div id="card-con11" class="card-con">

        <p>
            Thank you for your service!  I understand you have everything this is open enrolment period it’s a good idea just to check.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I know you’re a veteran you have VA coverage but you are also paying for Medicare right? They take $135 out of your check? There are benefits that Medicare will offer you that cost $0 that will not affect whats going on with your VA. You are already paying Medicare might as well take advantage to the extra benefits they are offering you. Let me connect you to the licensed agent to explain what I’m talking about.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="card-con13" class="card-con">
        <h4>What are the benefits you are talking to?</h4>
        <p>
            Benefits that we're talking about is more on your vision ,hearing , transportation  ,Over the counter Cards ,  Gym Etc, just to name a few… There are a lot of new benefits that medicare has to offer also the savings that might get for these years  
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="card-con14" class="card-con">
        <h4>What do you get out of it?</h4>
        <p>
            That’s a good question.! I don’t get anything I am with the national enrollment center we are just trying to help ..
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="card-con15" class="card-con">
        <h4> My Medicare Card is NOT HANDY  im not near my card , is it OK to talk to a licensed agent ..?</h4>
        <p>
            That’s not a problem  , you don’t need that physical card  to have a conversation to my  licensed agent ..
        </p>

    <div id="card-con16" class="card-con">
        <h4> I LOST my Medicare Card somewhere , can you help me get a NEW Medicare Card  ..? </h4>

            simply call Medicare Hotline nos. if you would like to get a NEW CARD… Right now , you don’t need the physical card to speak with my  licensed agent  
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="card-con17" class="card-con">
        <h4>Client is NOT PAYING ANYTHING with their medicare</h4>
        <p>
            i understand you pay $0 most plans are designed that way, what we are looking to do is possibly lower your copays at the doctor and hospital as well as get you more additional benefits at no additional cost.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="card-con18" class="card-con">
        <h4>if they say I DONT HAVE COPAYS  now</h4>
        <p>
            great that means you possibly have a special qualification which will allow you to increase benefits like dental vision hearing transportation and OTC card at no additional cost
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="card-con19" class="card-con">
        <h4>How much will it cost me?</h4>
        <p>
            I’m glad you asked.  Some plan may cost as a little as $0.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="card-con20" class="card-con">
        <h4>You can’t lower my cost because I don’t have any</h4>
        <p>
            Is it because you have Medicaid which is the special qualification that needed in order you get the extra benefits like dental vision hearing and transportation that you might be entitled to.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="card-con21" class="card-con">
        <h4>I already got it</h4>
        <p>
            Ok no problem. It is a good idea to check and make sure you have the best plan in the area. If we can get you a higher amount towards those benefits like dental and vision for your eye glasses I am sure you would like to know about that right?
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="card-con22" class="card-con">
        <h4>1. I already change/review my medicare</h4>
        <p>
            The reason why we are giving you a call is that Medicare recently updated its benefits so there are a lot of VARIETIES of new benefits that you are not aware of but you "MAY" qualify and that is for NO EXTRA COST so you don't have to worry okay?

            I do understand that you already spoke to someone but our assessment "Might" be different since Medicare recently updated so there are a lot of VARIETIES of new benefits that you are not aware of like CASH ASSISTANCE and the UTILITY BENEFITS for NO EXTRA COST okay?
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="card-con24" class="card-con">
